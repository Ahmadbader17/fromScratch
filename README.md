# fromScratch

Welcome to **fromScratch**, a repository where I implement various machine & deep learning algorithms **from the ground up** without using pre-built libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. 

This project aims to **deepen my understanding** of machine learning fundamentals by manually constructing each algorithm, ensuring a step-by-step breakdown of the theory, math, and implementation.

## Project Goals

- Gain an in-depth understanding of **how machine & deep learning algorithms work**.
- Build **foundational implementations** for key algorithms without external libraries.
- Improve programming skills, **numerical computing**, and algorithm design techniques.
- Provide a **reference guide** for anyone looking to learn how these algorithms are built from first principles.
