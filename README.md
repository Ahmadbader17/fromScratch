# fromScratch

Welcome to **fromScratch**, a repository where I implement various machine learning algorithms from the ground up without using pre-built libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. This project aims to deepen my understanding of machine learning fundamentals by building everything from scratch.

## Project Goals

- Gain an in-depth understanding of how machine learning algorithms work.
- Build foundational implementations for key machine learning algorithms.
- Improve programming skills and algorithm design techniques.
- Provide a reference for anyone looking to learn how these algorithms are built step-by-step.
