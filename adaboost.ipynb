    "#### What is AdaBoost?\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost is an iterative algorithm that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Trains a sequence of weak learners (e.g., decision stumps).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Assigns higher weights to misclassified samples in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Combines the weak learners into a strong learner by weighting their predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Weak Learner: A model that performs slightly better than random guessing (e.g., a decision stump, which is a decision tree with only one split).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Sample Weights: Each training sample is assigned a weight, which determines its importance during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Model Weight: Each weak learner is assigned a weight based on its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How AdaBoost Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize equal weights for all training samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Train a weak learner on the weighted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Compute the error of the weak learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Update the sample weights: Increase weights for misclassified samples and decrease weights for correctly classified samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Assign a weight to the weak learner based on its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Combine all weak learners into a strong learner using weighted voting.\n",
